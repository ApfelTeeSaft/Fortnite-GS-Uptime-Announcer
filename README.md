# Fortnite-GS-Uptime-Announcer
a very primitive try on an uptime announcer, it should work with every version

 ## How to use
 1. Download Python 3.11
 2. Download the Files from the Repository
 3. Start the file "install_packages.bat"
 4. Edit the file ".env" and change the variables and add a webhook link (leave the delay and the gameserver name default if using reboot)
 5. Start the Script by clicking on "start.bat"
 6. Done! :D

## Please credit me when using this on a public server :D
